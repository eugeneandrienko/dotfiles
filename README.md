### Contents

* `cmd/` - shell-related configuration files.
* `utils/` - configuration files for different utilities, like vim or tmux.
* `noauto/` - different system configuration files, not for automatic installation. Described below.
* `deploy.sh` - main deployment script.

#### noauto/ contents

* `hosts` - `/etc/hosts` file. This is not a valid `hosts` file! You should review it and add useful entries to your `/etc/hosts` by hands!
* `st` - configuration file for st terminal emulator.

### Before install

In the `$HOME` should exists `secure/` catalog which should be encrypted.

### Install

Clone this repository to some suitable directory.

You **mustn't** clone it to your `~` directory!

Run *deploy.sh* script, which do the next:
* Make soft links from our catalog to the user $HOME catalog.
* Create necessary empty directories.
* Create mail directories.
* Set right access rights to some configuration files.

### After install

#### Haskell programs

Install next programs via `cabal install`:
* hasktags
* stylish-haskell

#### Emacs plugins compilation

Run `C-u 0 M-x byte-recompile-directory` to recomplile contents of `~/.emacs.d/plugins`.

#### File synchronization

To work with file synchronization via cloudsync you need to have `sync` SSH-key with empty passphrase. This key should be added to remote server to rsync account into
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

#### Passwords

For using Mutt with GMail mailboxes you should specify mail server passwords in `~/secure/.netrc`.

#### /etc/hosts

You should update your `/etc/hosts` with data from `noauto/hosts`.

#### doas setup

If you need to control brightness of display when starting X-server â€” add next line to `doas.conf`:

```
permit nopass drag0n as root cmd tee args /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
```
