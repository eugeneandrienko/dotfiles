* About this repository

This repository contains different configuration files, which I have been
writing since 2005.

* Contents:
- =cmd/= — shell-related configuration files.
- =utils/= — configuration files for different utilities, like emacs or msmtp.
- =noauto/= — different system configuration files, not for automatic
  installation. Described below.
- =scripts/= — scripts to:
  - save private credentials
  - backup editor plugins
  - install/update JOSM.
- =deploy.sh= — main deployment script.

** =noauto/= contents:
- =hosts= — =/etc/hosts= file. This is not a valid =hosts= file! You should
  review it and add useful entries to your =/etc/hosts= by hands!
- =50trackball.conf= — X configuration for Logitech trackball
- =50-udiskie.rules= — Rules for udiskie. Should be placed in
  =/etc/polkit-1/rules.d/=. Owner should be =polkitd=, and access right should be
  =644=.
- =97-udisks2.rules= — Rules for udiskie [2]. Should be placed in
  =/etc/udev/rules.d/=.
- =userChrome.css= — Disable tabs and tabbar in Librewolf. Should be placed in
  =~/.librewolf/your-profile-folder/chrome/=.

  annoyances. Should be placed in =~/.librewolf/your-profile-folder/=.

* Before deployment:
If you need sensitive data (passwords, API keys, etc) in the new machine — use
=store_sensitive_data.sh= script to save it in archive on the old machine and
move to the new machine.

On the new machine you should do the next, to import sensitive data:
** File synchronization:
To work with file synchronization via cloudsync you need to have =sync=
SSH-key with empty passphrase. This key should be added to remote server to
=rsync= account into =~/.ssh/authorized_keys=.

** Passwords:
For using GMail with =fetchmail= and =msmtp= you should specify mail server
passwords in =~/.netrc=.

** Import GPG keys:
Use this commands:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
gpg --import pub.key
gpg --import priv.key
#+END_EXAMPLE

After that call =gpg --edit-key <key-id>= and set trust level to 5 via command
=trust=. Quit gpg console with =quit= command.

* Deployment:
1. Clone this repository to some suitable directory. You *mustn't* clone it to
   your =~= directory!
2. Run =deploy.sh= script, which do the next:
   1) Make soft links from our catalog to the user $HOME catalog via stow.
   2) Create necessary empty directories.
   3) Create mail directories.
   4) Set right access rights to some configuration files.
   5) Store in =~= special file with OS and hardware type of machine where
      this repository is cloned to. It is necessary to properly handle some
      functions, which should exists on one machine and shouldn't on another.

* After deployment:
** Emacs plugins and fonts installation
=Mu4e= e-mail client should be install via the OS package manager, for example:
#+begin_example
sudo pkg install mu4e
#+end_example

Run this after first Emacs run:
#+begin_example
M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts
#+end_example

Fonts should be installed to =~/.local/share/fonts/=. After installation:
- Run =fc-cache -f -v ~/.local/share/fonts/=, if not executed by
  =all-the-icons-install-fonts= itself.
- Restart Emacs daemon

** /etc/hosts:
You should update your =/etc/hosts= with data from =noauto/hosts=.
